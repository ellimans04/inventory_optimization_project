# Inventory Optimization Project
# Excel and Power-BI
## Introduction ##
I crafted actionable insights using advanced data analytics tools for best inventory management practices including; 
> ABC Inventory Classification, 
> XYZ Classification, 
> Inventory Turnover Ratio, 
> Calculation of Safety Stock/Buffer Stock & Reorder points, 
> Stock Status Classification, 
> ABC Pareto Chart & Demand Forecasting.

It is beneficial for Warehouse/ In-plant Inventory Managers to effectively control the Inventory levels and maintain the Service Levels.
Increase revenue by effective prioritizing strategies;
> Minimize overstocked inventory
> Minimize obsolete inventory
> Create optimized and efficient ordering systems.
